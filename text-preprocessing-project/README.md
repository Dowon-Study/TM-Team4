# Text Preprocessing Project

This project implements various text preprocessing techniques for natural language processing (NLP), focusing on Korean text. It utilizes libraries such as KoNLPy, PyKoSpacing, and SOYNLP to enhance the quality of text data for further analysis and modeling.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required packages. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Place your raw text data in the `data/raw` directory.
2. Use the Jupyter notebook located in `notebooks/preprocessing.ipynb` to experiment with different preprocessing techniques.
3. Processed data will be saved in the `data/processed` directory.
